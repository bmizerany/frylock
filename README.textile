*Install:*

gem install bmizerany-sinatra

*Example:*

Let's say we want to run our app like this:

<pre><code>ruby script.rb hello</pre></code>

Then we write this:

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'bmizerany-frylock'

command :hello do
  puts "Hello!"
end</pre></code>

If we want and optional name:

<pre><code>ruby script.rb hello Blake</pre></code>

Add a command with proc that has an arity of 1 and it will be matched instead of the first command

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'bmizerany-frylock'

command :hello do
  puts "Hello!"
end

command :hello do |name|
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end</pre></code>
